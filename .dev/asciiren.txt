ASCII ren:

Types (Gameasset types):   # Specific filenames or with .gameasset and the type propertie
  Sprite
  Text
  Box
  Tileset
  Animation/Anim
  UIasset # static
  UIlayout # takes layout configuration with characters (config files)
  ScriptableObject # Scripted object consisting of draw calls, such as draw_line.


Function calls:
  loadAsset(file,buffer)
  renderAsset(data,[pos],[size],buffer,linewrap) # Size is optional

###
Buffering is when asciiren saves the data to a variable in either the global or localscope (option-needed)
so when it tries to load/render an asset it pulls/puts the data in the variable.
Buffering is enabled by default but can be disabled to allow so called "live-assets" where it loads it everytime from file to allow rendering file changes.

Size is if you want to limit how big a asset can go (cut-of)

Linewrap is false by default so the render cuts of textures at the end of the console (console-size-cutoff)
with it enabled however if just wont cut of textures so textures at the end will be linewrapped.


Al game assets are rendering based on type in either fileextension or type propertie
