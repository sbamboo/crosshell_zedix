# Function to render sprites, taking a multitude of keyword arguments (arguments with specific order and name)
# TextureFile can only be given a string and must be the first argument. It must be a string since it says '=str()'.
# ScreenCordX is the screen X cordinate, to render the top right corner of the sprite at. It is the width value and is an integer. Screen cordinates are often described with the Y value first so if you use them that way please switch them.
# ScreenCordY is the screen Y cordinate, to render the top right corner of the sprite at. It is the height value and is also an integer.
# Color is an optional argument it dosen't have to be used. But if you do please supply the ANSI color code (ONLY THE CODE) to use (this applies to the whole sprite). If it isn't specified the script won't apply any formatting
