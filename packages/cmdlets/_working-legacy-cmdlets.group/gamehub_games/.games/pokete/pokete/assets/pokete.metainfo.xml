    <p>
      Pokete is a small terminal based game in the style of a very popular and old game by Gamefreak. Imagine you're a Pokete-Trainer and your goal is it to run around in the world and catch/train as many Poketes as possible and to get the best trainer.

    <release type="stable" version="0.9.0" date="2022-09-13" urgency="low">
      <description>
        <p>Quite a lot happened until this release: Moved some NPCs out of the way. Fixed a small bug with `gen_wiki.py` on windows. Added new `first evolution` achievement. Added new Poketes (Pavous, Uberpavous, Kartmen, Kakraholt, Bablbam). Volume settings with a funky new volumeslider. A new `--no_audio` commandline option to supress all audio. Stats for Poketes. Infos about the effect an attack has. The complete game is now resizable. Reduced stack traces. This release now requires `scrap_engine` on v1.4.0. Many thanks to @ondrejmyska for your many contributions.</p>

      <description>
        <p>Version 0.8.2 fixes a display bug of the release notes on flatpak. Version 0.8.1 on the other hand brought the following improvements: This version brings a new cross-platform implementation of how the audio is played, written in go. This makes the installation size of pokete significantly smaller, as less dependencies are required. The first map has been reworked, to make it easier for new players to understand the game.</p>

      <description>
        <p>We are constantly developing pokete further and with version 0.8.0 added a low of improvements and new features, such as music and sound effects. Running away from wild poketes can now fail and trainers can now have more than one pokete. Controls and hotkeys can now be remapped for different keyboard layouts. The default safe-file location has been moved to .local/share and some minor bugs have been fixed as well!</p>
