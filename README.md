Crosshell written in python (Codename: Zedix)

*This project is in early development so packages are still included in this repostitory instead of being downloaded from official sources so please refer to the official sites for any files/packages/assets sourced from other places.*

Crosshell is a hobby project of mine and aims to be a host for smaler apps, where someone can make a smal script and run it through crosshell. Thus crosshell acts like a shell. 
I usualy create similar projects to this when I wan't to learn a new programing language and crosshell is my try to make the app in python. Since I want some amount of backwards compatability to my previous versions of the project I also want the app to be able to run diffrent scripts not justs the same as the app, as an example crosshell can run Powershell scripts since my previous version was made in Powershell. (This uses a powershell install so it only works on systems with powershell installed)

Since the app itself is one part and the diffrent scripts or so called "cmdlets" should be able to be licensed sepparately and this mostly being a hobby project I haven't found a good license for it so currently I have written my own. This does however make it harder for others to contribute or use this project so I am open to feedback regarding licensing of the project. However if someone want's to use my code or contribute to it please contact me personaly. And I will be loking in to more permissive and clear licenses in the future.

If anyone has a tips for the project or a solution to a problem create an issue in the repository and I will try to read it.
